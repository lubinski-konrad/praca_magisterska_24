2329,Unbelievable,unbelievable,Much of the power of the series comes from watching the stellar performances by Collette and Wever as two alpha females who spar with each other as they solve the crime.,1
2330,Unbelievable,unbelievable,"Somehow, miracle of miracles, a mainstream Hollywood production has finally gotten a Christian character right.",1
2331,Unbelievable,unbelievable,"In lesser hands Unbelievable might slowly unravel, but in the hands of writers Susannah Grant, Michael Chabon and Ayelet Waldman, and director Lisa Cholodenko, it gets more riveting by the second.",1

2333,Unbelievable,unbelievable,One of Unbelievable's strongest elements is the relationship between these two women - enhanced by the actors' skill in creating a prickly relationship between two strong personalities.,1
2334,Unbelievable,unbelievable,"This story about the pursuit of a serial rapist in California could have been lurid or tacky, but instead it's commendably thoughtful and spends almost all its time on the victims and their struggle to be believed.",1
2335,Unbelievable,unbelievable,"On Unbelievable, we really see a difference between what happens to survivors who are believed and the ones who are written off from the start.",1
2336,Unbelievable,unbelievable,"Further, while the writing is definitely elevated by the quality of the cast, the script is lean and moves along at a snappy pace, striking a perfect balance between exhilarating tension and deep despair.",1
2337,Unbelievable,unbelievable,"Unbelievable is the best, most human, most complex police procedural I've seen in a long, long time.",1
2338,Unbelievable,unbelievable,Toni Collette and Merritt Wever are an instantly likable female empowered duo that I want more of.,1
2339,Unbelievable,unbelievable,Unbelievable is an engrossing and perfectly put together series.,1

2343,Unbelievable,unbelievable,"[A]bout 10 hours after I had started watching, I found myself finishing episode eight, completely overwhelmed by the humanity, intelligence and warmth of this brilliant show.",1
2344,Unbelievable,unbelievable,"This is based on true events and it is excellent and insightful and important and also works as a straight-up taut, gripping thriller.",1
2345,Unbelievable,unbelievable,"This is biting, gripping, and not least moving.",1
2346,Unbelievable,unbelievable,"Unbelievable might be the first cop show to focus not on how ""impartial objectivity"" is the only way to handle an investigation, but how much that objectivity can actually f*ck it.",1
2347,Unbelievable,unbelievable,It makes great television.,1
2348,Unbelievable,unbelievable,That is precisely the narrative decision that the series creators have taken: what matters is the word. [Full Review in Spanish],1
2349,Unbelievable,unbelievable,"What takes it to the next level are the finely honed performances by the three lead actresses as well as a meticulous deconstruction of how the criminal justice system treats those brave enough to report sex crimes, and whom it chooses to believe.",1
2350,Unbelievable,unbelievable,Series such as... Unbelievable do something else too: They impose justice on a world that is anything but fair.,1
2351,Unbelievable,unbelievable,"Unbelievable is a riveting and, ultimately, vindicating watch in its own right, but it's also a useful counterpoint to how such series are typically made.",1
2352,Unbelievable,unbelievable,"While not a spotless transition from article to script, it's very much a ""show, don't tell"" portrayal of the real-life events and fallout, which lands in a must-watch spot that is thought-provoking without being preachy.",1
2353,Unbelievable,unbelievable,"Unbelievable isn't light viewing. But in defending reality against received wisdom and eschewing suspense in favor of insight, it makes a plea for revising simplistic rape narratives.",1
2354,Unbelievable,unbelievable,"This is a faithful adaptation that plainly lays out the victims' stories and lets the audience see for themselves how differently they were treated, down to every question.",1
2355,Unbelievable,unbelievable,Unbelievable does what very few shows centred around sexual assault have managed to do: It debunks the black and white narratives of the social and systemic politics of rape.,1
2356,Unbelievable,unbelievable,Unbelievable needs to be excruciating and infuriating but also watchable. And the platform where it airs might be the only place where it can accomplish that goal.,1
2357,Unbelievable,unbelievable,"It's equally a sad and enraging look, fictionalised in terms of character names but otherwise faithful to the source material.",1
2358,Unbelievable,unbelievable,Unbelievable is and will remain a Netflix series not to be missed.,1
2359,Unbelievable,unbelievable,"The obstacles to reporting rape and other crimes of sexual nature are still to this day, astronomical. But the women of Unbelievable make it feel like justice could be within our grasp.",1
2360,Unbelievable,unbelievable,"Unbelievable also features an exceptional array of talent, starting with writer-creator Susannah Grant... Her scripts are executed by three remarkable actresses.",1
2361,Unbelievable,unbelievable,"Anchored by three quiet but powerful performances, particularly Kaitlyn Dever's systematically overruled Marie who so often expresses herself in silence, Unbelievable centers the human toll of these blights on our national character.",1
2362,Unbelievable,unbelievable,Toni Collette and Merritt Wever make a formidable team of detectives.,1
2363,Unbelievable,unbelievable,"Unbelievable confronts harsh realities and is hard to watch at times, but it is essential viewing.",1
2364,Unbelievable,unbelievable,Unbelievable doesn't make for easy watching...but it's one of the most complex onscreen depictions of sexual assault in recent memory.,1
2365,Unbelievable,unbelievable,"Most of the best moments are simple, like Duvall's pensive reactions to new information: shock or grief or excitement silently written on Wever's face. The story tells itself.",1
2366,Unbelievable,unbelievable,"Difficult to watch, but absolutely necessary, the new Netflix miniseries handles an important subject with the empathy, patience, and respect that it deserves.",1
2367,Unbelievable,unbelievable,"Kaitlyn Dever's performance as a damaged, exploited product of a flawed foster care system is utterly explosive",1

2370,Unbelievable,unbelievable,"Unbelievable has strong writing and performances, and the fact that the story is based on actual events makes Marie Adler's part of the story all the more remarkable.",1
2371,Unbelievable,unbelievable,"The series is a warning, a devastating example of the consequences of not believing women. But the writers successfully prevent it from becoming pedantic or hacky.",1
2372,Unbelievable,unbelievable,"Unbelievable isn't a programme about whether Adler was telling the truth. It's about who gets to have their story heard, who is allowed to be believed.",1
2373,Unbelievable,unbelievable,"This story would be real (even if it hadn't been based on true life events), it is the honest fear and the hardship of women told in eight visceral chapters.",1
2374,Unbelievable,unbelievable,"The best crime dramas, whether fiction or fact, find an emotional core within the clinical procedural details. Few achieve that balance better than Unbelievable.",1
2375,Unbelievable,unbelievable,"This is a smart and knowing investigative procedural, a stylish but never exploitative true-crime story, an insightful character study - and one of the best series of the year.",1
2376,Unbelievable,unbelievable,"As thematically fascinating as Unbelievable can be, it's also often dramatically plodding, if not grueling.",0
2377,Unbelievable,unbelievable,"The most standout aspect of Unbelievable, though, is that it shines light on survivors and heroes, rather than dwelling upon the psyches of perpetrators of violent crimes.",1
2378,Unbelievable,unbelievable,"It's an uncommon treat to see such a strong, multi-generational cast of women holding together a work that illuminates a vitally important issue.",1
2379,Unbelievable,unbelievable,"'Unbelievable' is a gripping and harrowing story that demands your attention throughout without ever sensationalising its subject matter, but rather handles it with the sensitivity and respect it deserves.",1
2380,Unbelievable,unbelievable,"This is a startlingly faithful adaptation and as such, it checks the boxes a piece of investigative journalism might check: It shows what happened, yes, but also why.",1
2381,Unbelievable,unbelievable,"It's a tough watch, but it's a rewarding one, not just because it has one of the best ensembles of the year but because of what it says about hope and empathy.",1

2388,Unbelievable,unbelievable,Unbelievable is a superb example of what show-don't-tell storytelling looks like.,1

2394,Unbelievable,unbelievable,"Unbelievable is an extremely satisfying experience - not just for its storytelling, but for its depiction of women who confront their reality rather than succumbing to it.",1
2395,Unbelievable,unbelievable,"Unbelievable, at its best, is focused less on the system at large than on one individual ground up by it.",1
2396,Unbelievable,unbelievable,Unbelievable is a knockout crime drama that pushes the genre ahead with tenderness.,1
2397,Unbelievable,unbelievable,"""Unbelievable"" is an extremely compelling suspenseful drama based on a true story.",1

2399,The Crown,the crown,"You've got to hand it to screenwriter Peter Morgan, he does know how to wring out every last drop of psychological drama from stories with which we might otherwise feel overfamiliar.",1
2400,The Crown,the crown,"The Crown has firmly placed itself as yet another vehicle of Britain's colonial amnesia, blissfully neglectful of the collective traumas of postcolonial nations.",0
2401,The Crown,the crown,"Eminently watchable, eternally classy, and enormously well performed, S4 sparkles and other points exasperates, but in that sense reflects the tenor of the era it covers.",1
2402,The Crown,the crown,"""White rich people dealing with white rich problems"" remains one of TV's most satisfying genres. In a year without Succession, no series could dethrone Peter Morgan's royal drama. The fourth season was the jewel in its crown.",1
2403,The Crown,the crown,"The Crown creators have outdone themselves this season, and as they prepare for a time jump and a cast change, it's sad to see such a strong cast go - but we can't wait to see what they have in store next.",1
2404,The Crown,the crown,"From the shy smile, to the cocked head and whispered voice, [Corrin] has perfectly captured the mouse that eventually roared.",1
2405,The Crown,the crown,"The Crown's fourth outing is the show back at its best. You may well come to it for the visual feast of Diana and Thatcher, but you'll leave with lots of food for thought - the mark of great telly.",1
2406,The Crown,the crown,"It is never gripping but it is always entertaining: a much-needed dollop of well-made, well-written, slowly-paced telly.",1
2407,The Crown,the crown,"It's telling that the most sympathetic newcomer this season is Michael Fagan, the Brit who sneaked into the palace in 1982 and confronted the queen in her bedroom.",1
2408,The Crown,the crown,"It is, without a doubt, the season many Crown viewers have been waiting for.",1
2409,The Crown,the crown,"The real star of this fourth season is, inevitably, Diana.",1
2410,The Crown,the crown,"The dissonance between spoiled Royals and the modern world has turned darker, and the nobility seems a lot less noble. But it's still a fascinating mess for us mere mortals to watch.",1
2411,The Crown,the crown,"Corrin beautifully brings to life the shy magnetism coupled with the fragile naivety of the iconic Princess, as well as the rumored affairs and eating disorder resulting from the pain and isolation of life inside a loveless marriage on the world stage.",1
2412,The Crown,the crown,It's the kind of run that would have kept the Queen Mum glued to the telly.,1
2413,The Crown,the crown,"Colman remains a delight, and I could watch her read a phone book.",1
2414,The Crown,the crown,"[It] does not suddenly find a low-key groove - it deploys a hunting metaphor with which it repeatedly slaps the viewer around the face in these first episodes - but because the subject matter is so big and bombastic, it does fit together with more ease.",1
2415,The Crown,the crown,"Decades of perspective and mythmaking make it impossible to turn away. This season, The Crown takes a step forward and lives up to the historical moments it brings to life.",1
2416,The Crown,the crown,"With Netflix finally delivering the long awaited arrival of Princess Diana and Margaret Thatcher, the pricey royal drama is back in gear with high drama and political intrigue, anchored by two era-defining women.",1
2417,The Crown,the crown,Sheesh. It's still a great watch.,1
2418,The Crown,the crown,"Just like the real royals, The Crown benefits from the arrival of Diana Spencer.",1
2419,The Crown,the crown,The Crown is deeper than just a sumptuous soap opera. It pictorially assesses the social consequences of a once great power in decline.,1
2420,The Crown,the crown,"The saga continues with outstanding performances by the entire cast but especially Emma Corrin, Josh O'Connor and Gillian Anderson.",1
2421,The Crown,the crown,This high-level soap so smoothly builds each climactic moment that even a less emotionally attached viewer will find that this season is one success after another.,1
2422,The Crown,the crown,There was an egregious lack of Porchey this season. Truly unforgivable.,1
2423,The Crown,the crown,"It's better than the last, which got bogged down a little in dead times. But there is, with modern times, the temptation to take sides; and there's little doubt where creator Peter Morgan has nailed his colours.",1
2424,The Crown,the crown,"Emma Corrin, as the princess, perfectly captured Diana's youthful spirit and slowly crumbling optimism. Gillian Anderson made a not terribly convincing Mrs Thatcher, far too mannered, even for made-over Maggie, but otherwise everyone was on their game.",1
2425,The Crown,the crown,"It's a triumph, this season, mostly because the Diana we've all been waiting for is a triumph. She is played by Emma Corrin, who is sensational.",1
2426,The Crown,the crown,It more than delivers on its consistency but my one major bug bear this time around is the humanisation of a woman who could have given Saddam Hussein a run for his money.,1
2427,The Crown,the crown,"Honest and unhampered by affectation, Colman, the most humble of stars, shows us how little Elizabeth knows and how much she needs to know in her changing world.",1
2428,The Crown,the crown,"Once more, the second episode of the fourth season returns The Crown to what makes this soap opera so delectable: It's a royal family trapped in archaic rituals cowering in palaces in the hopes of continued survival.",1
2429,The Crown,the crown,The real-life melodrama about Great Britain's royal family was already the most addictive show on TV... but now it's way better.,1
2430,The Crown,the crown,"The Crown is shrewd enough to start the new series with Charles and Di, but the Prince of Wales needs a crash course in pomposity.",1
2431,The Crown,the crown,Diana's arrival gives The Crown a chance to recapture the magic of spectacle. Few series evoke a sense of awe and wonder quite like Morgan's Royal Family fantasies.,1
2432,The Crown,the crown,"Emma Corrin is superb as Diana, always believable in her journey from naive teenager thrown in at the deep end to driven yet lonely powerhouse. (Though I'm now over allegorical stags being stalked at Balmoral.)",1
2433,The Crown,the crown,"Emma Corrin captures the shyness of Diana's public face, and it is hard not to empathise as she is left to wallow alone for weeks on end.",1
2434,The Crown,the crown,"The Crown takes addictive soap opera drama and elevates it to grand, cinematic heights with picturesque locations, opulent sets, well-researched costumes, and a moving score.",1
2435,The Crown,the crown,"The more Gillian Anderson pops into the narrative, the more obvious she's crafted this role into the finest of an already lauded career.",1
2436,The Crown,the crown,Series four of The Crown ranks as the most entertaining yet because of the depth of its engagement with the times in which it's set.,1
2437,The Crown,the crown,You know there are problems with Gillian Anderson's performance from the moment the camera settles on her ashen Back to the Future hair.,0
2438,The Crown,the crown,"I don't know how much literal truth there is in the story The Crown is telling about the royals... But the season's insights into our emotions and familial volatility, and its ways of articulating it in such reflective ways, need no added research.",1
2439,The Crown,the crown,"These Charles/Di go-rounds may indeed butter ""The Crown's"" bread, but the real news this time is Gillian Anderson's devastatingly precise portrayal of Margaret Thatcher.",1
2440,The Crown,the crown,"While I have no doubt Imelda Staunton will be terrific in the final seasons, The Crown has a way of making you regret the inevitable march of time.",1
2441,The Crown,the crown,"It's a credit to newcomer Corrin and partner-in-despair Josh O'Connor - a needy, narcissistic and thoroughly unsympathetic Charles - that their relationship does more than simply rake over old ground.",1
2442,The Crown,the crown,"Give Gillian Anderson an Emmy. That's it, that's the sentence.",1
2443,The Crown,the crown,"With Season 4, the stakes are higher across the board and the bingeworthiness returns. Spectacular performances go down. Corrin is heartbreaking during many moments, and Gillian Anderson is reaching out for an Emmy.",1
2444,The Crown,the crown,"No longer is The Crown merely showing us history, it's making us feel it as if we were living (or reliving) it.",1
2445,The Crown,the crown,"Diana's entry into The Crown has been anticipated since the series was first announced, and Corrin's portrayal of the Princess of Wales is delicate and assured enough to live up to the high expectations first-time viewers of the series may have.",1
2446,The Crown,the crown,Perhaps the best and most riveting season of the series yet.,1
2447,The Crown,the crown,"This season has finally added the last, previously missing piece: a universally gripping narrative.",1
2448,The Crown,the crown,Gillian Anderson might be the best Thatcher ever seen on screen. Hers is not so much an impersonation as an inhabitation.,1
2449,The Crown,the crown,"There is a welcome, absorbing quality to jumping back into ""The Crown.""",1
2450,The Crown,the crown,"The entrances of Emma Corrin as Princess Diana and Gillian Anderson as Margaret Thatcher steal the show with tour-de-force performances, but the whole cast elevates their game in The Crown's most powerful season yet.",1
2451,The Crown,the crown,The characters are excellently utilized by the acting quality. [Full review in Spanish],1
2452,The Crown,the crown,The emotionally charged fourth season of The Crown is a staggering achievement.,1
2453,The Crown,the crown,"The Crown is also at its best when it explores the economic and political crises throughout our country's history, which it does a lot in this series.",1
2454,The Crown,the crown,This is the season of The Crown you've been waiting for.,1
2455,The Crown,the crown,"The Crown continues being one of the best original series on Netflix, giving us excellent scripts, direction, performances, production values, and the ability to transport us to moments on screen. [Full review in Spanish]",1
2456,The Crown,the crown,"Gillian Anderson is a revelation in the role of Thatcher, giving one of the finest performances of her career.",1
2457,The Crown,the crown,"The fourth season of The Crown is nothing short of spectacular. Bringing to life Britain under Thatcherism, and weaving in the story of the young Princess Diana and her dysfunctional marriage with Prince Charles is prodigiously delivered.",1
2458,The Crown,the crown,Anderson's brilliant portrayal shows the prime minister at her most human and her most inhumane.,1
2459,The Crown,the crown,"For three seasons, as it dutifully focused on Elizabeth and her immediate family, The Crown sometimes seemed to give itself nothing to push back against...this season, it belongs to the victims as well.",1
2460,The Crown,the crown,Diana's much-awaited appearance suggests The Crown's appeal does not necessarily lie in the trappings of monarchy so much as in the possibility of its destruction.,1
2461,The Crown,the crown,Season 4 manages to perfectly capture everything we love to hate about this fictitious version of the royal family and is only elevated by Anderson and Corrin's introductions of Thatcher and Diana.,1
2462,The Crown,the crown,Helena Bonham Carter's Princess Margaret is beautifully nuanced and Olivia Coleman as Queen Elizabeth continues her stellar work.,1
2463,The Crown,the crown,No longer are we gazing at expensively made period drama about barely knowable people. We are looking in the rearview mirror at people and events that galvanized the world not long ago.,1
2464,The Crown,the crown,"10 episodes of television that may not be uniformly among the show's finest, but which are somehow its most authentic.",1
2465,The Crown,the crown,"The new season of the series is delicious, and I ate it up rather quickly, and now I'm hungry for more. It's as beautifully shot as ever, every visual is breathtaking.",1
2466,The Crown,the crown,"The best and most addictive season yet. All 10 episodes are a binge-watcher's dream. Olivia Colman is the shining jewel in 'The Crown,"" but Emmy love, please, for Emma Corrin as Lady Di and a knockout Gillian Anderson as Margaret Thatcher.",1
2467,The Crown,the crown,"In season four, the show's resemblance to The Godfather is more pronounced than ever. The royals have more in common with a crime family than they'd perhaps like to believe, but at least the Corleones cared for each other.",1
2468,The Crown,the crown,"Sadly, what we get here from the Peter Morgan-created series is substantially tweaked timelines and substandard soap that is far less ""character"" and more live-action spitting image caricature.",0
2469,The Crown,the crown,"If anything, Season 4 of ""The Crown"" suffers from an overabundance of plotlines that beg for more attention, whether it's Princess Margaret coping with her diminished status, or the bracingly snide depiction of Prince Andrew.",1
2470,The Crown,the crown,"This new set of episodes continues to give us both the long run and the short, the epic and the specific, as it goes from strength to strength.",1
2471,The Crown,the crown,"The season that finally introduces Diana, Princess of Wales, is one of the series' strongest.",1
2472,The Crown,the crown,"Season four of The Crown leans heavily on the Charles/Diana drama, but is still a great watch.",1
2473,The Crown,the crown,Best season yet.,1
2474,The Crown,the crown,"The Crown observes that the royals' failures can more often than not be self-inflicted -- and in doing so, the show produces its most thrilling and biting season yet.",1
2475,The Crown,the crown,"Anderson's transformation is mesmerizing, not least the feeble, raspy voice that belies the strength and ruthlessness with which Thatcher sets about her business.",1
2476,The Crown,the crown,"The dramatic pacing of this season is very intelligent, as is its decision to leap beyond the palace walls from time to time to illustrate the straitened circumstances of those at the wrong end of Mrs Thatcher's laissez-faire capitalist experiments.",1
2477,The Crown,the crown,"The show remains an utterly enjoyable binge, even if the latest season doesn't quite measure up to the previous ones -- a byproduct of the years and conflicts encompassed.",1
2478,The Crown,the crown,"Corrin is startlingly good at capturing the princess' charismatic shimmer. Her Diana is silly and eager for attention... Yet this winsome young woman also exudes warmth, decency and fun.",1
2479,The Crown,the crown,"Ultimately, though, what Thatcher and especially Diana do is land maternal doubts at Elizabeth's feet. It's a facet of the queen we've seldom seen even on The Crown.",1
2480,The Crown,the crown,"The sheer audaciousness of the script continues to thrill: how could anyone know what the Queen and Princess Anne talked about, seated on a picnic blanket in the middle of nowhere?",1
2481,The Crown,the crown,"Together, Thatcher and Diana give The Crown an energy and a sense of direction it lacked in the third season, and a feeling of verve the show has arguably never approached before.",1
2482,The Crown,the crown,"The result is an absorbing season, both incredibly satisfying and, often, painful to watch unfold.",1
2483,The Crown,the crown,There's no fairy tale here; only a real-life soap opera plotline that played out in front of billions. That's part of the reason why this season works so well.,1
2484,The Crown,the crown,"'The Crown' Season 4 finds itself caught between trying to maintain its gilded scenery and elegant trappings, and the lurid tabloid appeal of indiscretions, martial chaos, and familial infighting. The results make for some sharply-realised drama.",1
2485,The Crown,the crown,"THE CROWN is an impeccably crafted, gorgeously shot, and fantastically performed saga. It loves its royals, yet also pities them, and maybe even reviles such scoundrels. You will too.",1
2486,The Crown,the crown,"If you think the Roys play a mean game of Boar on the Floor, wait until you see the Royals!",1
2487,The Crown,the crown,"Much of series three felt like a warm up act, a prelude to bigger, better drama. With the arrival of some new blood in the form of Gillian Anderson's Thatcher and Emma Corrin's Princess Diana, round four provides just that.",1
2488,The Crown,the crown,"I remember in detail almost every event here that I found it so entertaining. Yes, there is a shaky start and the odd historical inaccuracy, but it is in my view Morgan's best series yet and, overall, five-star television.",1
2489,The Crown,the crown,"Many actresses have essayed Mrs Thatcher, but her biographer Charles Moore is surely correct in his assertion that Gillian Anderson's performance here is the most convincing yet.",1
2490,The Crown,the crown,"Playing Lady Diana from a waifish teen to a young wife to a miserable princess, Emma Corrin nails the head tilts and shy smiles, effortless glamour, and inner turmoil.",1
2491,The Crown,the crown,"Smooth, perhaps not. But it's definitely soapy. For all its flaws, The Crown gives us what we demand from the royal cavalcade - nonstop high drama and emotion, wrapped in a fairytale.",1
2492,The Crown,the crown,The stillness at the centre of this storm is Colman. She is quietly riveting as the plot wends its way to a predictable conclusion.,1
2493,The Crown,the crown,"The show wouldn't work nearly as well as it does, however, without its uniformly excellent performances",1
2494,The Crown,the crown,"The main takeaway in Season 4, though, will be Morgan's interpretation of the story of Charles and Diana and the performances of Josh O'Connor and Corrin in those roles.",1
2495,The Crown,the crown,"Anderson embodies the PM's physicality precisely. Aided by the words of writer, creator and executive producer Peter Morgan, Anderson gifts Thatcher with a rare nuance and flinty emotion that reads as entirely authentic.",1
2496,The Crown,the crown,"The Crown has successfully sold itself as one of TV's most serious dramas. The fourth season, in all its shameless glory, may be its most successful yet even as it puts that prestigious perception to bed.",1
2497,The Crown,the crown,"The Crown season four is a success, by and large - especially when it comes to Charles and Diana - but at times I did feel it was uneven and imperfect.",1
2498,The Crown,the crown,"Even when The Crown isn't at its best from a story perspective, the series remains one of the best looking shows out there, from a technical standpoint.",1
2499,The Crown,the crown,The show seriously falters with Diana... The Crown prides itself on verisimilitude and that starts to fall away in Season 4.,0
2500,The Crown,the crown,"What makes Corrin a good Diana is that she too possesses an inherent charm and appeal. She remains sympathetic throughout, even in scenes with O'Connor when the two are shouting at one another as their marriage collapses.",1
